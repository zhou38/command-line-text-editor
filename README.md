This program is a simple command-line text editor written in Rust. It allows users to open a text file, edit it, and save the changes back to the original file.

The main logic of the program is as follows:

First, the program checks the command-line arguments to ensure that the user has provided the filename to edit. If no filename is provided, it prints the usage information and exits.

Then, the program attempts to open the specified file. If successful, it reads the contents of the file into a Vec<String> type vector called lines. Each line of text is stored as a string.

Next, the program enters an infinite loop, waiting for user input commands.

Users can enter the following commands:

p or print: Prints the contents of the current file. The program iterates over the lines vector and prints the content of each line.

a <content> or append <content>: Appends a line of content to the end of the file. The program adds the user input content to the end of the lines vector.

i <line_num> <content> or insert <line_num> <content>: Inserts a line of content before the specified line number. The program inserts the user input content at the specified line number in the lines vector.

d <line_num> or delete <line_num>: Deletes the content at the specified line number. The program removes the element at the specified line number from the lines vector.

q or quit: Exits the editor. The program breaks out of the loop and continues with the subsequent code.

After the loop ends, the program writes the updated lines vector back to the original file. It first creates a new file writer and iterates over the lines vector, writing each line of text to the file.

That's the basic logic of this simple text editor. It uses some types and functions from the Rust standard library, such as the env module for retrieving command-line arguments, the fs module for file operations, and the io module for input and output operations.
